# Capstone-Project

## Goals of the Project
To see whether it would be possible to accurately predict the price of Airbnb listings, with the idea of being used to guide pricing for Airbnb hosts.



The aim of this project is to predict the rating and price of an Airbnb listing. The dataset will be created by scraping the Airbnb website using Selenium, gathering different information such as the reviews, title, rating, price etc.

After cleaning the data, I will then predict the rating and price, using regression models, with a focus on using NLP on the reviews that people have left.
