# Capstone-Project

## Goals of the project
To see whether it would be possible to accurately predict the price of Airbnb listings, with the idea of being used to guide pricing for Airbnb hosts.

## Why I created the project
I loved scraping when I first learned it, and so wanted to test myself with a harder challenge. I am also a keen Airbnb user, and wondered how hosts first price their listing, either via trial and error or research, in order to come to a fair price. Therefore, I combined the two, and came up with this project.

## Methodology and approach
I scraped the Airbnb website using Selenium, gathering information such as reviews, rating, and a target of price. I then cleaned the data, engineering several different features. Finally, I predicted the price (per night), using regression models, with a focus on using NLP on the reviews that people have left.
